KEEN RISK (KERI) - C Programming course material delivered by slides-as-code.

## Description

KERI was created to aid in the revision and formatting of C programming training material.
KERI was named in honor of [KErnighan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Kernighan) and [RItchie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Ritchie), without whom the landscape of our global society would be surprisingly unfamiliar.  Additionally, I believe the phrase "keen risk" is a vaguely accurate description of the C programming languge.
