8.4 Demonstrate skill in creating and using a hash table that accepts any data type
===================================================================================

----

Objectives
========================================

* Creating a hash table with n number of items
* Navigating through a hash table to find the nth item
* Finding an item in a hash table
* Removing selected items from a hash table
* Inserting an item into a hash table
* Implement functionality to mitigate hash collisions within the hash table
* Removing all items from the hash table

.. note::

	I intend to accomplish these objectives in incremental stages.

Overview
========================================

* "Any data type"
* Data Structure Bookkeeping
* Hash Function
* Mitigating Hash Collisions
* Resizing
* Resources
* Student Labs

STUDENT LABS
========================================

All labs will utilize the 8-04-hash_table-lab "library".
8-04-hash_table-main.c is available to validate your work.

* 8-04-1: Implement basic functionality: create, find, insert, remove, remove all, destroy
* 8-04-2: Mitigate hash collisions
* 8-04-3: Extend hash table capacity

.. note::

	How should the students handle duplicate entries?  Error, replace, etc?

----

Resources
========================================

* PLACEHOLDER

.. note::

	This is a good chance to ask the students if they have any questions.
