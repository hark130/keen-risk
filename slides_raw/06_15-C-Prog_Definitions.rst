6.15 Describe terms associated with compiling, linking, debugging, and executables
========================================

----

Objectives
========================================

* [Describe terms associated with] Portable Executable (PE)
* [Describe terms associated with] Executable and Linkable Format (ELF)
* [Describe the] Difference between PE and ELF
* [Describe the] Difference between a library (shared object / DLL) and a regular executable program
* [Describe the] Calling convention/Application Binary Interface (ABI)

.. note::

	This JQS item seems to be missing an explicit objective covering the *actual* terms associated with compiling, linking, and debugging.

	Harkjective: Describe terms associated with compiling, linking, and debugging C programs.

Overview
========================================

* Disclaimer
* C Compilation Stages
* PE vs ELF
* Libraries vs Executables
* Calling Convention/ABI
* Checklist

----

DISCLAIMER
========================================

Memorizing terms, for the sake of memoriziation, is useless.
Meaningful memorization comes with experience.

.. note::

	"We will discuss these terms now but experience them later.  With that experience, comes memorization."

	The students may not be able to describe all of these terms by the end of 6.15.
	However, they should be able to describe all of these terms well before the end of the C Programming
	block of instruction.

	The post-Definitions plan is to regularly refer back to the "Checklist" until everyone can describe everything.
	Following that, the students should be able to pass short multiple-choice quizzes.
